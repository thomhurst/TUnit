# Mocking

TUnit is a testing framework focused on test execution and does not include any built-in mocking capabilities. This gives you the freedom to choose whichever mocking library best suits your needs and preferences.

You can use any .NET mocking library with TUnit, such as NSubstitute, Moq, FakeItEasy, or any other mocking framework that works with .NET.
