# Single Responsibility Principle Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved HookOrchestratingTestExecutorAdapter Creation to TUnitServiceProvider

**Before:**
- `TestExecutor` was responsible for creating its own `HookOrchestratingTestExecutorAdapter` in the `CreateExecutorAdapter` method
- This violated SRP as `TestExecutor` had multiple responsibilities

**After:**
- `HookOrchestratingTestExecutorAdapter` is now created in `TUnitServiceProvider` 
- It's injected into `TestExecutor` via constructor dependency injection
- `TestExecutor` now only focuses on test execution orchestration

### 2. Moved FailFastCancellationSource to Service Provider

**Before:**
- `TestExecutor` managed its own `CancellationTokenSource` for fail-fast functionality
- This was another responsibility that didn't belong in the executor

**After:**
- `FailFastCancellationSource` is now created and managed by `TUnitServiceProvider`
- It's registered as a service and can be accessed by components that need it

### 3. Updated Dependencies

- Added `HookOrchestratingTestExecutorAdapter` parameter to `TestExecutor` constructor
- Updated `TestRegistry` to use the injected adapter (user had already started this)
- Removed `CreateExecutorAdapter` and `IsFailFastEnabled` methods from `TestExecutor`

## Benefits

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each class now has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Improved Testability**: Dependencies are injected, making unit testing easier
3. **Centralized Service Creation**: All services are created in one place (TUnitServiceProvider)
4. **Reduced Coupling**: Components no longer create their own dependencies

## Code Quality Improvements

- Removed duplicate logic for checking fail-fast configuration
- Simplified `TestExecutor` by removing service creation responsibilities
- Made the dependency graph more explicit and easier to understand
