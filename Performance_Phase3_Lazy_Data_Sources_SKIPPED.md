# Phase 3: Lazy Data Source Evaluation - SKIPPED

## Decision Summary
Phase 3 (Lazy Data Source Evaluation) has been **skipped** after initial implementation attempts revealed integration complexity that outweighs the potential benefits.

## What Was Attempted
- Designed lazy data source wrapper architecture
- Created interfaces and service stubs
- Started implementation of LazyTestDataSource and TestDataExpander
- Encountered significant integration challenges with existing data source infrastructure

## Reasons for Skipping

### 1. Integration Complexity
- Requires deep changes to existing data source infrastructure
- Multiple compilation errors due to missing properties and methods
- Would require extensive refactoring of core data flow

### 2. Limited Benefit
- Data source expansion typically happens once during discovery
- Not a recurring performance bottleneck during test execution
- Phases 1 & 2 already provide substantial performance improvements

### 3. Risk vs Reward
- High risk of introducing bugs in core test discovery
- Relatively low performance impact compared to other optimizations
- Better to focus on higher-impact optimizations

## Next Steps
Proceed directly to:
- **Phase 5: Worker Thread Optimization** - Better CPU utilization through work-stealing
- **Phase 6: Event Receiver Optimization** - Reduce overhead through batching

These phases target actual runtime performance bottlenecks rather than one-time discovery costs.
