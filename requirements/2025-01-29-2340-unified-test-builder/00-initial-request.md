**Request:** unified test builder

## User's Original Request
The user is requesting a unified test builder approach for the TUnit testing framework.

## Initial Understanding
This appears to be related to consolidating or unifying the test building mechanisms within TUnit, possibly to:
- Simplify the test creation/registration process
- Reduce code duplication
- Improve maintainability
- Provide a consistent API for test construction

## Context
TUnit is a modern, source-generated testing framework for .NET that uses compile-time test discovery through source generators.
