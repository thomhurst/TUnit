# Phase 1 Implementation Summary: Expression Caching

## Overview
Successfully implemented expression caching for reflection mode to eliminate redundant expression compilation during test discovery.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created ExpressionCacheService.cs
- Location: `/TUnit.Engine/Services/ExpressionCacheService.cs`
- Thread-safe caching using `ConcurrentDictionary`
- Separate caches for instance factories and test invokers
- Statistics method for monitoring cache effectiveness

### 2. Modified ReflectionTestDataCollector.cs
- Added static `ExpressionCacheService` instance
- Refactored `CreateInstanceFactory` to use caching
- Refactored `CreateTestInvoker` to use caching
- Extracted compilation logic into separate methods: `CompileInstanceFactory` and `CompileTestInvoker`
- Added diagnostic logging for cache statistics

### 3. Key Implementation Details
- Cache keys:
  - Instance factories: `ConstructorInfo`
  - Test invokers: `(Type declaringType, MethodInfo method)` tuple
- No changes to public APIs
- Maintains AOT compatibility
- Zero behavioral changes

### 4. Diagnostic Integration
- Integrated with `DiscoveryDiagnostics` for monitoring
- Cache statistics logged when diagnostics are enabled
- Tracks both initial discovery and dynamic assembly loading

## Expected Benefits
- Significant reduction in CPU usage during discovery
- Cache hit rates of 50-90% for typical test suites
- 20-40% reduction in discovery time for reflection mode
- Memory usage bounded by unique constructors/methods

## Testing
- Code compiles successfully for all target frameworks (.NET Standard 2.0, .NET 8, .NET 9)
- No functional changes to test execution
- Cache statistics available through diagnostics

## Next Steps
1. Benchmark discovery performance with real test suites
2. Monitor cache hit rates in production scenarios
3. Consider implementing Phase 2: Streaming Discovery Architecture
4. Gather metrics on actual performance improvements

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Implementation is isolated to reflection mode
- Cache contention handled by `ConcurrentDictionary`
- Memory growth limited by unique method signatures
- No impact on AOT mode

## Code Quality
- Follows SOLID principles:
  - SRP: Cache service has single responsibility
  - DRY: Centralized caching logic
  - KISS: Simple implementation using standard collections
- Maintains existing code structure
- Minimal changes to existing code paths
