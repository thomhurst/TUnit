            Additional instructions:
            - ALWAYS post a review comment, even if no issues are found. If the code is good, acknowledge it.
            - When you find issues, ALWAYS suggest better approaches or architectural improvements, not just minor optimizations.
            - Focus on:
              * Design patterns that could be improved
              * Alternative approaches that are more maintainable or scalable
              * Architectural concerns or anti-patterns
              * Better abstractions or simplifications
            - Skip minor style/formatting issues unless they impact readability significantly.
            - Always explain WHY the suggested approach is better, not just WHAT to change.
