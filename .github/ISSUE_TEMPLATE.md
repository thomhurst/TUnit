### Please check the following before raising an issue

- If this is a question, have you checked the documentation at https://thomhurst.github.io/TUnit ? 
  - If you can't find anything there, start a discussion instead at https://github.com/thomhurst/TUnit/discussions
- If your issue is with a specific piece of functionality, please include code that reproduces the problem. This will make fixes much quicker.
- Ensure you've checked any existing issues so you're not creating a duplicate. If you find an existing issue, feel free to contribute on that thread, and provide any more context if you can.
- Is your issue with an IDE such as Rider or Visual Studio? I generally can't fix these, so issues should be reported directly to those teams. E.g. Jetbrains or Microsoft.
- Do you want a new feature or functionality? Start a discussion first so we can decide together.
- Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines](../tree/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) ?
