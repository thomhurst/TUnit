/// <summary>
/// Specifies that a test method, test class, or assembly should not be executed in parallel with other tests that share the same constraint keys.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The NotInParallelAttribute helps control test execution to prevent tests from interfering with each other when they
/// access shared resources. When multiple tests share the same constraint key, they will be executed sequentially rather than in parallel.
///
/// NotInParallel can be applied at the method, class, or assembly level.
/// When applied at a class level, all test methods in the class will follow the parallel execution constraint.
/// When applied at the assembly level, it affects all tests in the assembly.
///
/// Method-level attributes take precedence over class-level attributes, which take precedence over assembly-level attributes.
///
/// Tests with no overlapping constraint keys can still run in parallel with each other.
/// To prevent a test from running in parallel with any other test, use the attribute without specifying constraint keys.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// // Prevent this test from running in parallel with any other test with the "Database" constraint key
/// [Test]
/// [NotInParallel("Database")]
/// public void TestThatAccessesDatabase()
/// {
///     // This test will not run in parallel with any other test that has the "Database" constraint
/// }
///
/// // Prevent this test from running in parallel with tests that have either "Api" or "Database" constraint keys
/// [Test]
/// [NotInParallel(new[] { "Api", "Database" })]
/// public void TestThatAccessesMultipleResources()
/// {
///     // This test will not run in parallel with tests that have "Api" or "Database" constraints
/// }
///
/// // Prevent this test from running in parallel with any other test
/// [Test]
/// [NotInParallel]
/// public void TestThatMustRunIsolated()
/// {
///     // This test will run exclusively
/// }
/// </code>
