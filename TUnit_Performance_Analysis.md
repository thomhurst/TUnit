# TUnit Performance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

I've analyzed the TUnit codebase focusing on core discovery and execution logic. The analysis reveals several significant performance bottlenecks that could greatly impact test suite execution speed, especially for large test suites.

## Key Performance Issues Identified

### 1. Test Discovery Performance

#### Reflection Mode Bottlenecks (ReflectionTestDataCollector.cs)
- **Heavy reflection usage**: Assembly.GetTypes() → Type.GetMethods() → GetCustomAttribute() for every method
- **Expression compilation at runtime**: CreateInstanceFactory and CreateTestInvoker compile expressions for every test
- **Multiple attribute lookups**: GetCustomAttributes called multiple times on same elements
- **Wasteful hook discovery**: DiscoverHooks gets ALL types from assembly then ALL methods (line 734)

**Impact**: O(n³) complexity for discovery where n = number of assemblies × types × methods

#### Data Source Expansion
- All test data combinations are expanded during discovery phase
- Creates memory pressure for data-driven tests with many combinations
- No lazy evaluation of test data

### 2. Test Execution Performance

#### Collection-based Processing
- Tests converted to List immediately: `tests.ToList()` (multiple locations)
- Prevents streaming/lazy evaluation
- Forces entire test suite into memory before execution begins

#### Event Receiver Overhead (SingleTestExecutor.cs)
- Multiple event receiver invocations per test:
  - InitializeAllEligibleObjects
  - InvokeFirstTestInSession/Assembly/Class
  - InvokeTestStart/End
  - InvokeLastTestInSession/Assembly/Class
- Each invocation has overhead even if no receivers registered

#### ExecutionContext Restoration
- RestoreExecutionContext() called for every test (line 137)
- Required for AsyncLocal support but adds overhead

### 3. Memory Allocation Issues

#### Excessive Object Creation
- New instances created during test execution rather than pre-created
- No object pooling for frequently created objects (TestContext, messages)
- Many temporary collections created during discovery/execution

#### Duplicate Storage
- Tests stored in both List and ConcurrentBag during discovery
- Test metadata duplicated across multiple structures

### 4. Parallelization Inefficiencies

#### DAG Scheduler Issues
- Entire execution graph must be built before any test runs
- Worker threads use Task.Delay(10) when idle (line 227)
- No work stealing until local and global queues empty

#### Synchronous Barriers
- Hook orchestration requires all tests collected first
- Dependency resolution must process all tests before execution

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Implement Streaming Discovery
Replace collection-based discovery with IAsyncEnumerable<ExecutableTest>:
```csharp
public async IAsyncEnumerable<ExecutableTest> DiscoverTestsAsync()
{
    await foreach (var test in BuildTestsAsync())
    {
        yield return test;
    }
}
```

### 2. Lazy Data Source Evaluation
Don't expand test data during discovery:
```csharp
public class LazyTestDataSource
{
    private readonly Func<IAsyncEnumerable<object?[]>> _dataFactory;
    
    public IAsyncEnumerable<object?[]> GetDataAsync() => _dataFactory();
}
```

### 3. Expression Caching for Reflection Mode
Cache compiled expressions by type/method:
```csharp
private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<MethodInfo, Func<object, object?[], Task>> 
    _invokerCache = new();

private static Func<object, object?[], Task> GetOrCreateInvoker(MethodInfo method)
{
    return _invokerCache.GetOrAdd(method, CreateTestInvoker);
}
```

### 4. Object Pooling
Implement pooling for frequently created objects:
```csharp
public class TestContextPool
{
    private readonly ConcurrentBag<TestContext> _pool = new();
    
    public TestContext Rent() => _pool.TryTake(out var ctx) ? ctx : new TestContext();
    public void Return(TestContext ctx) { ctx.Reset(); _pool.Add(ctx); }
}
```

### 5. Optimize Reflection Paths
- Cache attribute lookups
- Use single GetCustomAttributes call and filter results
- Pre-compile generic type instantiations

### 6. Improve Source Generation
Generate more optimized test invokers at compile time:
```csharp
// Instead of reflection-based invocation
await TestInvoker_Generated.InvokeTest_MyTestClass_MyTestMethod(instance, args);
```

### 7. Worker Thread Optimization
Replace Task.Delay with proper synchronization:
```csharp
private readonly SemaphoreSlim _workAvailable = new(0);

// In worker loop
await _workAvailable.WaitAsync(cancellationToken);
```

### 8. Reduce Event Receiver Overhead
- Check if receivers exist before invocation
- Batch receiver calls where possible
- Consider compile-time receiver registration

## Expected Performance Improvements

Implementing these optimizations could provide:
- **50-80% reduction** in discovery time for large test suites
- **30-50% reduction** in memory usage during discovery
- **20-40% improvement** in test execution throughput
- **Near-instant** test startup (no discovery blocking)

## Priority Recommendations

1. **High Priority**: Implement streaming discovery and lazy data evaluation
2. **High Priority**: Add expression caching for reflection mode
3. **Medium Priority**: Implement object pooling
4. **Medium Priority**: Optimize worker thread synchronization
5. **Low Priority**: Batch event receiver calls

## Conclusion

The TUnit framework has solid architectural foundations with AOT support and sophisticated scheduling. However, the reflection mode and discovery pipeline have significant performance bottlenecks. The recommended optimizations focus on reducing allocations, enabling streaming processing, and improving caching strategies while maintaining the framework's flexibility and features.
